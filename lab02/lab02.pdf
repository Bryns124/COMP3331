Exercise 3: Using Wireshark to understand basic HTTP request/response messages
1. The status code and phrase is "200 OK"
2. The HTML file was last modified on "Tue, 23 Sep 2003 5:29:00 GMT." It also has a DATE
header which says "Tue, 23 Sep 2003 5:29:50 GMT" and these fields are different by 50 seconds.
3. The connection established is persistent as the http connection contains a header called
"Keep-Alive" that has a timeout of 10 and max of 100. This maintains the connection between
the client and the server and reduces the amount of time needed to serve files between servers.
4. There are 73 bytes of data as seen in the "File Data" header.
5. The data contained inside the HTTP packet response is 3 lines of html code printing
"\n
Congratulations. You've downloaded the file lab2-1.html!\n
\n"

Exercise 4: Using Wireshark to understand the HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/response interaction
1. No, there is no "IF-MODIFIED-SINCE" line in the HTTP GET
2. Yes, the file was last modified on Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:35:00 GMT
3. Yes. They exist as:
"If-Modified-Since: Tue, 23 Sep 2003 05:35:00 GMT" and 
"If-None-Match: "1bfef-173-8f4ae900""
4. The status code returned to the second HTTP GET was 304 with the description of 
"Not Modified." The server did not return the contents of the file as the file had
not been modified.
5. The value of the Etag in the 2nd response is ETag: "1bfef-173-8f4ae900". This is used
to compare the specific versions of a resource and as the file has not been modified, 
the Etag remains the same as in the 1st response.
