Exercise 1: nslookup
Use the nslookup command from the "Tools of the Trade" and answer the following questions:

1. The IP address of www.koala.com.au is both 172.67.219.46 and 104.21.45.210. The reason for having several IP addresses as an output is that
is supports load balancing in that, rather than having just one IP address to send all the traffic to, having two or more IP addresses splits
up this amount of traffic and prevents the server from overloading.

2. 127.0.0.1 is called the 'localhost' or 'loopback' address. The address is used to establish an IP connection to the same machine or computer 
being used by the end-user.

Exercise 2: Use ping to test host reachability
Reachable:
www.unsw.edu.au
www.mit.edu
www.intel.com.au
www.tpg.com.au
www.amazon.com
www.tsinghua.edu.cn
8.8.8.8
Unreachable:
www.getfittest.com.au - the given hostname could not be identified, which likely means that the hostname does not exist.
www.hola.hp - the given hostname could not be identified, which likely means that the hostname does not exist.
www.kremlin.ru - the given hostname exists however, it is unreachable possibly due to security or ping time reasons.

8.8.8.8 is Google's public DNS. Can use this service for free 

Exercise 3: Use traceroute to understand the network topology
Note: Include all traceroute outputs in your report.

1. There are 24 routers between my workstation and www.columbia.edu. There are 3 routers along the path that are a part of UNSW.
Packets likely cross the Pacific Ocean between 113.197.14.137 and 138.44.228.5 as the largest jump time occurs between those two
IP locations.
2. The router that the paths diverge from is 113.197.15.147. The number of hops is not necessarily proportional to the physical distance as 
there could be a higher number of routers in a smaller physical area and vice versa.
3. The IP location for www.speedtest.com.sg is 202.150.221.169 and the IP location for www.steadfast.net is 208.100.4.50. The reverse path 
does not seem to go through the same routers as the forward path and this may be because of the variable paths the traceroute is able to take.

Exercise 4: Use ping to gain insights into network performance
1. 
2. The delay varies over time.
3. Transmission and queueing delay are affected by the size of the packet, while propogation and processing is not.
